Hi sir,

I am a student at Daffodil International University, in the Computer Science and Engineering department. This is my first project using the C Programming Language.

**Project Title:** PhoneBook Management Project
In the `about.txt` file, I have included brief information about our team members. The other file contains the main code.
There are some features implemented, while others are still in progress. I will continue to improve the project.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Arpon Sarker
